The following symbolic link:

  /home/interlock/.ssh -> /home/interlock/.interlock-mnt/.ssh

is included to allow users to upload an authorized_keys file within the
encrypted partition, exposed through INTERLOCK, and mounted on .interlock-mnt.

This allows optional SSH access as the interlock user for TextSecure
registration, debugging and upgrading.
